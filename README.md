# MTI-Xsens-IMU
A KNN-based evaluation system for Xsens MTU IMU data. The project loads clean and noisy sensor datasets, performs analysis and visualization, and builds a multi-output KNN regressor to predict temperature, pressure, rotation, and magnetic field. Includes preprocessing, model evaluation, plots, and saved model.
